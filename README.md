# Fighters Toolkit (`ft`)

A native C++17 library and CLI for reading, converting, and repacking game assets from
the Jane's combat simulator family (FA, USNF, ATF).

**Supported games:**
- Jane's Fighters Anthology (1998)
- Advanced Tactical Fighters (1996)
- U.S. Navy Fighters (1994)

## Acknowledgements

Format specifications were made possible by the
**[OpenFA project](https://gitlab.com/openfa/openfa)** (GPLv3, Rust) — the definitive
reverse-engineering reference for all FA file formats. All credit for the original
reverse engineering goes to the OpenFA contributors.

## Why this exists

The original FATK (DuoSoft 1998) is a 16-bit app that won't run on 64-bit Windows.
OpenFA's `ofa-tools` is excellent but Rust-only. Fighters Toolkit provides:

- A **zero-dependency, statically-linked** `ft.exe` — drop it anywhere and run it
- A **static C++ library** (`ft_lib`) — embed in any GUI, script via ctypes, link from C#

## Building

Requires Visual Studio 2022 or 2026 (MSVC). CMake ships with VS but isn't in PATH:

```powershell
$cmake = "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\18\Community\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\CMake\CMake\bin\cmake.exe"
& $cmake -B build -G "Visual Studio 18 2026"
& $cmake --build build --config Release
# Output: build\cli\Release\ft.exe
```
