# Theater / Map Layout (.MM)

FA_2.LIB contains 75 `.MM` files. Each defines a theater — the complete scene description for a group of missions: terrain reference, weather, object placements, waypoints, and terrain tile overrides. Format is **plain ASCII text** with a keyword/argument syntax, CRLF line endings.

## File Structure

Sections appear in this order:

1. **File header** — global scene parameters
2. **`sides` block** — faction alignment table
3. **`time` / `historicalera`** — time of day and era
4. **`obj` blocks** — static object placements
5. **`special` blocks** — named map labels (cities, bodies of water)
6. **`tmap` entries** — sparse terrain tile overrides
7. **`tmap_named` entries** — named tile positions (present in some files)
8. **`waypoint2` blocks** — AI/scripted waypoint sequences (present in some files)
9. **`tdic` blocks** — per-tile collision/passability bitmaps

## Header Keywords

| Keyword | Arguments | Description |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| `textFormat` | *(none)* | File type marker — always the first line |
| `map` | `<name>.T2` | Terrain map file to load |
| `layer` | `<name>.LAY <index>` | Cloud/atmosphere layer file and slot index |
| `clouds` | `<int>` | Cloud density (0 = none) |
| `wind` | `<speed> <direction>` | Wind speed and bearing |
| `view` | `<x> <y> <z>` | Initial camera world-space position |

---

## Sides Block

Defines faction alignment. Four variants across all 75 files:

| Keyword | Entry count | File count |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| `sides` | 18 | 9 |
| `sides2` | 19 | 32 |
| `sides3` | 24 | 9 |
| `sides4` | 64 | 25 |

Each entry is a tab-indented hex byte: `$00` = neutral/friendly, `$80` = hostile to the player.

The table is a **flat array indexed by faction code**: entry *i* = hostility of side code *i*. The number suffix (2/3/4) is a format version indicating how many faction codes are defined — each version is a strict superset of the previous (`sides2[0–18]` == `sides3[0–18]` == `sides4[0–18]`; `sides3[0–23]` == `sides4[0–23]`). Theaters added in later FA versions use a higher-numbered variant to cover newly introduced faction codes.

The `nationality` field in `obj` blocks is **not** an index into this table — it is a cosmetic UI code (country flag/emblem in briefings) and can exceed 162, far beyond the 64-entry maximum.

---

## Object Block (`obj`)

Each `obj` block defines one static scene object. Terminated by a lone `.` line.

| Field | Arguments | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `type` | `<name>.OT` | Object type reference |
| `pos` | `<x> <y> <z>` | World-space position |
| `angle` | `<yaw> <pitch> <roll>` | Orientation in degrees |
| `flags` | `<hex>` | Object state/behaviour flags (see below) |
| `speed` | `<int>` | Initial speed |
| `alias` | `<int>` | Unique object ID (negative integers) |
| `nationality` | `<int>` | Primary faction code |
| `nationality2` | `<int>` | Secondary faction code |
| `nationality3` | `<int>` | Tertiary faction code |
| `name` | `<str>` | Display name |
| `color` | `<int>` | Color index |
| `icon` | `<int>` | Map icon ID (`-1` = no icon) |
| `react` | `<hex> <hex> <hex>` | Hostile faction bitmask: three 16-bit words covering faction codes 0–47 (bit *n* set = react to faction *n* as hostile) |
| `searchDist` | `<int>` | AI detection radius |
| `skill` | `<int>` | AI skill level |
| `tdic` | `<int>` | Tile dictionary index |
| `special` | *(none)* | Marks object as a special/scripted entity |
| `w_for` | `<int>` | Waypoint owner reference |

### `flags` Bit Survey

8 distinct values observed across all 75 files (8,373 `obj` blocks total):

| Value | Bits | Object types | Count |
|-------|------|--------------|-------|
| `$0` | — | Decorative buildings, flags, landmarks (no game logic) | 471 |
| `$1` | 0 | Fuel depots, bunkers, strips, flags (friendly?) | 968 |
| `$3` | 0, 1 | Mobile military units — all `.NT` (AA guns, SAMs, fighters) | 232 |
| `$401` | 0, 10 | Fuel depots, control towers, strips, flags | 5,524 |
| `$403` | 0, 1, 10 | Mobile military units — all `.NT` | 241 |
| `$601` | 0, 9, 10 | Named structures (carrier KING.OT, houses, factory) | 24 |
| `$4003` | 0, 1, 14 | Runways (STRIP1, DTSTRP, STRIP5, STRIP7) | 906 |
| `$4403` | 0, 1, 10, 14 | Runways (STRIP4, STRIP) | 2 |

Confirmed bit meanings:
- **Bit 0 (`$1`)** — present on all non-decorative objects; likely "active / participates in game logic"
- **Bit 1 (`$2`)** — set on mobile units (`.NT`) and runways; "mobile or functional structure"
- **Bit 14 (`$4000`)** — set only on runway strips; "landing surface"

Tentative (requires Ghidra confirmation):
- **Bit 10 (`$400`)** — distinguishes some objects from structurally identical ones without it (e.g. `$1` FUEL vs `$401` FUEL — possibly friendly vs hostile ownership)
- **Bit 9 (`$200`)** — only on named/significant structures with bit 10 set; possibly "mission-critical target"

### Example

```
obj
    type STRIP1.OT
    pos 890323 0 462935
    angle 0 0 0
    nationality3 185
    flags $4003
    speed 0
    alias -10100
    .
```

---

## Special Block (`special`)

Named geographic labels shown on the theater map (cities, seas, landmarks). Same field set as `obj` but without `type`.

```
special
    pos 1816892 0 1071944
    name East Falkland
    color 48
    icon -1
    flags $0
    .
```

## Terrain Tile Data

### `tmap` — Sparse tile overrides

Only non-default tiles appear; the grid is otherwise implied from the `.T2` terrain file.

```
tmap <col> <row> <tile_id> <variant>
```

- `col` and `row` are multiples of 4 (grid coordinates in 4-unit steps)
- `tile_id` is an index into the terrain tile set
- `variant` is a sub-tile selector (0–3 observed)

### `tmap_named` — Named tile positions

Like `tmap` but with a symbolic key encoding the position:

```
tmap_named k<col3><row3> <col> <row>
```

The key `k<col3><row3>` zero-pads column and row to 3 digits each (e.g. `k000004` = col 0, row 4). The explicit `<col>` and `<row>` arguments are always identical to the values encoded in the key — they are redundant. Present in maps that reference these tiles from scripts or other systems.

---

## Waypoint Block (`waypoint2`)

```
waypoint2 <count>
    w_index <int>
    w_flags <int>
    w_goal <int>
    w_next <int>
    w_pos2 <unk> <unk> <x> <altitude> <z>
    w_speed <int>
    w_wng <int> <int> <int> <int>
    w_react <int> <int> <int>
    w_searchDist <int>
    w_preferredTargetId <int>
    w_name <str>
    [next waypoint entry...]
```

`count` is the number of waypoint entries that follow. Each entry begins with `w_index`. `w_pos2` has 5 arguments; the first two are always `0 0` in observed files.

**`w_goal` values**: only `0` and `1` observed across all 75 files (192 waypoints total). `w_goal 0` always appears with `w_flags 1` and `w_speed 0` (stationary anchor/spawn point); `w_goal 1` appears with `w_flags 0`, a non-zero speed, and a `w_react` bitmask (active patrol waypoint). Exact goal-type semantics require Ghidra trace.

## Tile Dictionary (`tdic`)

Follows the `tmap` section. Each `tdic` block defines a 4×8 binary passability/collision grid for a tile variant.

```
tdic <id>
    <b0> <b1> <b2> <b3>
    <b0> <b1> <b2> <b3>
    ... (8 rows)
```

Values are `0` (passable) or `1` (blocked). `<id>` observed as 256 in all cases.

## Location

| LIB | Count |

| FA_2.LIB | 75 |

## TODO — Deep Dive

- Determine world-space coordinate scale and origin for `pos` / `view` values (requires Ghidra)
- Confirm `obj flags` bit 10 and bit 9 semantics (friendly vs hostile ownership; mission-critical — requires Ghidra)
- Confirm `tdic` id=256 meaning (tile type index into T2? — requires Ghidra)

**Confirmed resolved:**
- `sides` suffix = format version (not faction count); table is flat array indexed by faction code; each version is a strict superset ✓
- `tmap_named` col/row arguments are redundant with key encoding ✓
- `w_goal` values surveyed: only 0 (stationary anchor) and 1 (active patrol) ✓
- `react` field = three 16-bit hostile-faction bitmasks covering codes 0–47 ✓
- `obj flags` bits 0, 1, 14 confirmed ✓
