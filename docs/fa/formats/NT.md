# NT — NPC / Vehicle Definition (.NT)

FA_2.LIB contains 84 .NT files. Each defines one non-player-controlled vehicle or unit type (tanks, ships, soldiers, SAM launchers, etc.).

**Format:** Brent's Relocatable Format (plain text). NOT a Win32 PE DLL. File sizes after decompression vary (e.g. M1.NT=1805 bytes, ZSU23.NT=similar).

**Location:** FA_2.LIB | **Count:** 84

**Related:** JT.md (weapons on hardpoints), SH.md (3D shapes), OT.md (static counterparts), AI.md / BI.md (AI system that drives _GVProc behavior)

## Structure

Two-section structure: OBJ_TYPE (physical object base — same layout as JT/OT) followed by NPC_TYPE.

## Notes

### AI Callbacks

| Symbol | Used by |
|--------|---------|
| `_GVProc` | Ground vehicles (tanks, APCs, trucks, soldiers) |
| `_SHIPProc` (likely) | Naval units |

### Hardpoints

Each hardpoint references a .JT file as its default weapon type. `ammo count = 32767` indicates unlimited ammunition. Multiple hardpoints are indexed sequentially (`defaultTypeName0`, `defaultTypeName1`, ...).

## File Inventory

| Category | Examples |
|----------|---------|
| Tanks | M1, T72, T80, T90, TYPE69 |
| APCs | M2, M113, BTR80, BMP2 |
| AAA | ZSU23, ZSU57, M163 |
| SAM launchers | SA2A, SA3, SA6, SA7, SA9, SA13-16, SA19, HAWK, ROLAND, MIM23, FIM92, HQ61 |
| Ships | IOWA, KIROV, KIEV, OSCAR, NIMZ, SFLUSH, OLEKMA, TICON, KNOX, KRIVAK, SOVR, JIANC, JIANE, PMORN, SESHDW |
| Vehicles | HUMVEE, TRUCK, LTRACK |
| Air units | CYCL (helicopter), EJECT (ejection seat) |
| Naval small | BARGE, CARGO, CARGO2, RBOAT, WASP, LCAC |
| Personnel | SOLDIER, TROOPS, CATGUY |
| Misc | SCUD, GCI, OILR, SACRAM, RUNNER |

## Calibration

### `obj_class` word — Confirmed values (full survey)

| Value | Class | Representative files |
|-------|-------|---------------------|
| `$40` | Personnel / infantry | CATGUY, EJECT, PLTDWN, RUNNER, SOLDIER, TROOPS |
| `$200` | Ground vehicle (non-combat) | HUMVEE, LTRACK, MISTRK, MULE_A/B/C, SFLUSH, SRDR1/2, TANKER, TRUCK |
| `$400` | Armor / tank | BMP2, BTR80, M1, M113, M1975, M2, T72, T80, T90 |
| `$800` | AAA | A_M1939, KS12, KS19, M163, M1939, ZIF31, ZSU23, ZSU57 |
| `$1000` | SAM launcher | 2S6, ASA5, CHAP, FIM92, HAWK, MIS, ROLAND, SA2A, SA3, SA6, SA7, SA9, SA13–16 |
| `$2000` | Naval vessel | BARGE, BUTLER, CARGO, CIM, CLEM, CYCL, FISHBT, IOWA, JIANC, JIANE, JUNK, KIEV, KIROV, KITT, KNOX, KRIVAK, LCAC, NIMZ, OILR, OLEKMA, OSCAR, PMORN, RBOAT, SACRAM, SARAN, SESHDW, SL100, SOVR, TICON, TICON, WASP |

`$40` (personnel) and ground structure `$100` are shared with OT files. Naval units (`$2000`) include CYCL (helicopter) — the game treats helicopters as naval-class objects. Aircraft fighter/bomber values (`$8000`, `$4000`) appear only in PT files.

The `_GVProc` proc symbol is shared across ground, AAA, SAM, and naval units; the proc likely dispatches internally on `obj_class`.

### Hardpoint flags — Confirmed patterns

All hardpoints have bit 3 (`$8`) set — this appears to be the "active weapon slot" marker.

| Flag | Observed in | Interpretation |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| `$8` | All ground-unit hardpoints; majority of naval hardpoints | Standard weapon slot — present on all weapon types |
| `$a` | Subset of naval hardpoints on ships with 4+ HPs | Bit 1 (`$2`) set in addition to bit 3: AI-guided weapon targeting active |

Bit 1 (`$2`) is **confirmed** as the AI-guided targeting flag — **`FUN_004736f0` (GVProc draw handler, param_1=5)**. When iterating type-7 missile hardpoints, the handler checks `*data_ptr & 2`; if set, calls `FUN_004c4700` (AI targeting update) to compute intercept geometry for that hardpoint. Ships like IOWA and KIROV use `$a` on specific hardpoints (Phalanx, Sea Sparrow, AAA30) that the ship AI actively steers toward targets; SARAN and KRIVAK with only 3 hardpoints do not use the AI-guided path.

SA2A has 6 hardpoints (launch tubes), all `$8`. Ships with 4 hardpoints mix `$8` and `$a` in varying ratios (e.g. IOWA 2+2, TICON 1+3).

### NPC_TYPE AI params — Confirmed (full survey)

| Field | Confirmed range | Interpretation |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|
| `aggressiveness` | 20 (most ground) / 40 (ships, capable SAMs) | Engagement aggression level |
| `skill` | 20–176 | Fire control accuracy; higher = better targeting |
| `reaction` | 20–80 | Threat acquisition speed; higher = slower (longer lock-on delay) |

Observed values by unit class:

| Unit type | aggressiveness | skill | reaction | Examples |
|-----------|---------------|-------|----------|---------|
| Ground vehicle (unarmed) | 20 | 60 | 40 | TRUCK, HUMVEE, MULE |
| Armor | 20 | 60 | 40 | M1, T72, BMP2, BTR80 |
| Basic MANPADS / short-range SAM | 20 | 60 | 40 | SA7, SA9, SA13-16, FIM92 |
| Basic AAA | 20 | 80 | 40 | ZSU23 |
| Advanced AAA (heavy caliber) | 40 | 80–100 | 40–60 | KS12, KS19, ZSU57, M163 |
| Advanced SAM | 40 | 144 | 60 | SA2A, SA3, SA6 |
| Naval vessel | 40 | 100 | 80 | IOWA, KIROV, most ships |

`TRUCK.NT` (no weapons at all) and `M1.NT` share identical AI params (20 / 60 / 40) — confirming these fields drive general NPC movement and threat-response behavior rather than weapon accuracy alone.

### `ot_flags` dword — Observed NT patterns

Full survey of all 84 NT files.

| Flag | Units | Bits active |
|------|-------|------------|
| `$821` | Most ground units (tanks, AAA, SAM, vehicles) | 0, 5, 11 |

| `$400` | CATGUY (carrier deck officer — visual only) | 10 |
| `$c8331` | Conventional carriers (CLEM, KITT, NIMZ) | 0, 4, 5, 8, 9, 15, 18, 19 |
| `$108331` | VSTOL carrier (WASP) | 0, 4, 5, 8, 9, 15, 20 |
| `$1c8131` | Hybrid carrier (KIEV) | 0, 4, 5, 8, 15, 18, 19, 20 |
| `$2000821` | Emplaced AA artillery (KS12, KS19, M1939) | 0, 5, 11, 25 |
| `$4000821` | SA2A only | 0, 5, 11, 26 |

**Bit semantics:**

| Bit | Mask | Label | Status | Notes |
|-----|------|-------|--------|-------|
| 0 | `$1` | Targetable | Confirmed | Absent on CATGUY (purely visual) and A_M1939 (zone marker) |
| 4 | `$10` | Naval vessel | **Confirmed** — `FUN_0043df7b` | Naval-weapon gate: weapon type 3 requires this bit; absent on all ground vehicles. |
| 5 | `$20` | Armed / valid combat target | **Confirmed** — `FUN_0043df7b` | Hard gate in targeting acquisition — entity with bit 5 clear is immediately rejected as a valid target. Absent on passive MULE/EJECT. |
| 8 | `$100` | Has collideable oriented hull | **Confirmed** — `FUN_0042c9b0` | When set with non-zero heading, uses angle-based hit detection (`FUN_004c6654`). Present on large ships; absent on small boats and ground vehicles. |
| 9 | `$200` | Large hull with 3D-oriented bounding box | **Confirmed** — `FUN_0042c9b0` | Tested combined as `& 0x300` (bits 8+9): triggers full 3D bounding-box rotation (`FUN_004d60d8`) for hit detection. Never set without bit 8. Large ships (carriers, oil rig, GCI); absent on standard destroyers/cruisers. |
| 10 | `$400` | Civilian/light type | **Confirmed** — `_Reaction_12` (0x464040), `_MaskEvents_4` (0x463ea0) | Infantry (SOLDIER, RUNNER), small civilian craft (FISHBT, JUNK, RBOAT), CATGUY. Drives `_Reaction_12` and `_MaskEvents_4` event-system handlers; also toggles bay-door actuator. Shared semantic with OT bit 10. |
| 11 | `$800` | Ground-mobile unit | **Confirmed** — `FUN_0042c9b0` | OBJ_TYPE+9 & 0x800 sets a ground-mobile state flag in targeting/collision resolver. Present on all ground vehicles; absent on naval vessels (carriers have it via extra bits). |
| 15 | `$8000` | Flight deck present | **Confirmed** — `FUN_00425196` | When set, forces targeting category to 4 (flight deck special class). Also tested combined with bit 22 (`& 0x408000`). All carrier types (CLEM, KITT, NIMZ, KIEV, WASP). |
| 18 | `$40000` | Carrier arrestor-wire deck | Inferred | Present: CLEM, KITT, NIMZ, KIEV; absent on VSTOL-only WASP. Not confirmed via entity+0x09 bit test — mask found only in runtime entity flags and game-state globals. |
| 19 | `$80000` | Carrier catapult deck | Inferred | Present: CLEM, KITT, NIMZ, KIEV; absent on VSTOL-only WASP. Not confirmed via entity+0x09 bit test. |
| 20 | `$100000` | VSTOL/helicopter deck | Inferred | KIEV, WASP; absent on conventional carriers without VSTOL. Not confirmed via entity+0x09 bit test. |
| 22 | `$400000` | Prominent/large variant | **Confirmed** — `FUN_0042c9b0` | When set, collision geometry uses hit-point count of 16; also tested combined with bit 15. |
| 25 | `$2000000` | Emplaced AA artillery | Inferred | KS12 (85mm), KS19 (100mm), M1939 (37mm). Not confirmed via entity+0x09 bit test. |
| 26 | `$4000000` | SA-2A fixed-site SAM | Inferred | SA2A only. Not confirmed via entity+0x09 bit test. |

### Proc symbols

| Symbol | Observed in | Role |
|--------|-------------|------|
| `_GVProc` | M1, ZSU23, TRUCK, IOWA, KIROV | NPC AI dispatcher (shared across all categories) |
| `_PROJProc` | (via JT) | Projectile physics |

## TODO

- **ot_flags bit 10 (`$400`)**: Confirmed resolved. `_Reaction_12` (0x464040) and `_MaskEvents_4` (0x463ea0) are the entity+0x09 & 0x400 testers.
- **ot_flags bits 18, 19, 20 (`$40000`, `$80000`, `$100000`)**: Still not confirmed at OBJ_TYPE+0x09 — no dedicated test functions found; tested inline only (NT bits 18–20 / 25–26 confirmed inline-only from Ghidra run). Labels "arrestor-wire/catapult/VSTOL deck" remain inferred from carrier category patterns.
- **ot_flags bits 25, 26 (`$2000000`, `$4000000`)**: Still not confirmed at OBJ_TYPE+0x09. Labels inferred from emplaced AA / SA-2A category patterns. Tested inline only.
