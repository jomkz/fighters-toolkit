# Campaign Definition (.CAM)

FA_2.LIB contains 6 `.CAM` files — one per built-in campaign. Pilot save files (`.P`) store the active campaign by this filename. Each is a **Win32 PE DLL** loaded by the FA engine at runtime.

## File Inventory

| File | Missions | Theater prefix |
|------|----------|----------------|
| BALTIC.CAM | 40 (`~B01.M`–`~B40.M`) | `B` |
| EGYPT.CAM | 40 (`~E01.M`–`~E40.M`) | `E` |
| KURILE.CAM | 35 (`~K01.M`–`~K35.M`) | `K` |
| UKRAINE.CAM | 50 (`~U01.M`–`~U50.M`) | `U` |
| VIETNAM.CAM | 25 (`~T01.M`–`~T25.M`) | `T` |
| VLAD.CAM | 40 (`~V01.M`–`~V40.M`) | `V` |

The `~` prefix on mission filenames is the game's notation for LIB-resident mission files.

## Format

Win32 PE DLL (`MZ` stub + PE32 image). The standard DOS stub message `"!This program cannot be run in DOS mode."` is present, followed by standard PE sections `.idata` and `.reloc`. `BALTIC.CAM` decompresses to **8704 bytes**; `UKRAINE.CAM` is larger to accommodate its 50-mission list.

All CAM files import from `main.dll` (= FA.EXE — see [ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md#overlay-system--win32-pe-dlls)) and export a campaign-specific set of functions that the engine calls to drive campaign state.

## Embedded Data

Each `.CAM` DLL embeds its campaign configuration directly in the data section as flat arrays and null-terminated strings. String analysis reveals:

### CD and LIB Reference
```
Fighters Anthology (CD 1)
FA_4C.LIB
```
The campaign specifies which installation disc and LIB archive it requires for its assets.

### Aircraft Availability
Named aircraft type identifiers listed before the weapon table — e.g. UKRAINE.CAM includes `SU33`, `F22N`; BALTIC.CAM includes `E2000`, `GRIPEN`, `RAFALE`, `ASTOVLF`. These are the aircraft the campaign makes available to the player.

### Weapon / Stores Tables
A sequence of BRF asset filenames (JT, GAS, SEE, ECM extensions) defines the weapon and sensor loadout pool for the campaign:

```
GSH301.JT   M61.JT    GAU12.JT  GSH30.JT  ADEN.JT   ...
F150.GAS    F250.GAS  F350.GAS  F500.GAS
AAS38.SEE   ALQ167.ECM
AA11.JT     AA12.JT   AIM7.JT   AIM9M.JT  AIM120.JT ...
```

### Mission List
Null-terminated strings of the form `~<prefix><NN>.M`, one per mission in sequence order:

```
~U01.M  ~U02.M  ...  ~U50.M   (UKRAINE.CAM — 50 missions)
~T01.M  ~T02.M  ...  ~T25.M   (VIETNAM.CAM — 25 missions)
```

### Campaign State Identifiers
Short string keys track per-mission and campaign-wide state:

| Pattern | Example | Meaning |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `<pre>NNI` | `U01I`, `U02I` | Mission initial (available/locked) state |
| `<pre>NNO` | `U01O`, `U03O` | Mission objective complete flag (odd-indexed in UKRAINE) |
| `<pre>MEDAL` | `UMEDAL` | Campaign medal awarded |
| `<pre>DEAD` | `UDEAD` | Player death recorded |
| `<pre>WON` | `UWON` | Campaign won flag |
| `<pre>LOST` | `ULOST` | Campaign lost flag |

## Reference Chain: .CAM → .M → .MM / .LAY / .MC

The `.CAM` DLL holds only its own mission list (`~<prefix>NN.M` strings). It does **not** reference `.MM` theater files, `.LAY` sky files, or `.MC` condition files directly. Those references are carried by each `.M` mission file via three keywords:

| Keyword | Target | Example |
|---------|--------|---------|
| `map` | `.MM` theater file | `map ukr.T2` → loads `UKR.MM` |
| `layer` | `.LAY` sky file | `layer day2.LAY 0` |
| `code` | `.MC` condition DLL | `code u01` → loads `U01.MC`; `code extra01` → loads `EXTRA01.MC` |

The `.MC` file to load is determined by the `code` directive in the `.M` file, not by the `.CAM` DLL. Most missions use a unique per-mission `.MC` (`U01.MC`, `K16.MC`, etc.); bonus missions share the generic `EXTRA01.MC` gate via `code extra01`.

## Loading Mechanism

`FUN_00428412` (0x428412) is the canonical FA.EXE campaign/mission loader. Called from the mission-map screen handler `FUN_00422a71` (when `_curScreen == 3`) and from `FUN_0042a71a`.

Execution sequence:
1. `_MISSIONShutdown_0()` — teardown prior mission
2. `_MISSIONInit1_0()` — engine pre-init
3. Select `.mc_M` file: `s__mc_nato_M_004f0ca8` or `s__mc_M_004f0ca0` based on `_natoFighters` flag
4. `_CallMissionProc_8(pcVar2, 0)` — load the campaign DLL
5. Copy mission name string; call `_CallMissionProc_8(&_missionName, 0)` for named missions
6. `_MISSIONInit2_0()` — post-DLL init; zeros six globals; calls `FUN_00422828`, `FUN_004242a0(0)`, `FUN_00428340`
7. `_T_NamedTmaps_0()` / `_T_InitDictionary_0()` — terrain dictionary initialization

`_CallMissionProc_8` (0x481940) is the central mission-DLL dispatcher. Its callers: `FUN_00428412`, `_ChooseScoreInit` (0x441c60), `_MISSIONTextProc@16` (0x481c10), `_MISSIONCheckSuccess@0` (0x486860), and `?usnfmain@@YAXXZ` (0x403700 — main loop).

## DLL Entry Point and Command Protocol

`AnalyzeCAMDLL.java` confirmed the dispatch function for KURILE.CAM (representative of all CAM DLLs). The single exported entry point is at PE code offset `0x1000` (`FUN_00001000`). FA.EXE calls it via `_CallMissionProc_8`, passing a command byte as the first stack argument (`in_stack_00000004`).

**Command byte protocol:**

| Cmd | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `0x00` | No-op / init query — returns immediately |
| `0x01` | String match + copy: scan `DAT_000014e1` (mission name string) against current `_missionName`, then copy result to `DAT_000017b6` |
| `0x02`–`0x03` | No-op |
| `0x04` | Flag check: if `DAT_000017bc != 0`, set `DAT_000017a4 = 1` and invoke the campaign callback subfunction |
| `0x05`–`0x08` | No-op |

Data globals are stored in the PE `.data` section at offsets around `0x1700`–`0x17C0`. The mission list string table starts at `DAT_000014e1`.

## Import Table (Functions CAM DLL Calls from FA.EXE)

The `.idata` section of each CAM DLL lists the FA.EXE functions it calls back into. Note: these appear in the CAM DLL's **import table** (calls out to FA.EXE) — they are not functions exported by the DLL.

**Common imports (all campaigns):**

| Function | Role |
|----------|------|
| `_AddCampaignPlane` | Add aircraft to campaign fleet |
| `_AddCampaignStore` | Add weapon/store to campaign pool |
| `_CampaignPlanesLeft@0` | Return remaining aircraft count |
| `_CheckCD` | Verify correct CD inserted |
| `_DoFadeout@0` | Trigger screen fade transition |
| `_GetKeySlow` | Wait for key input |
| `_InitCampaignPilot` | Initialize pilot state for campaign start |
| `_SeqContinue` | Resume a cutscene sequence |
| `_SeqStart` | Start a cutscene sequence |
| `_campaignFailed` | Handle campaign failure outcome |
| `_campaignFailures` | Access failure count |
| `_campaignSucceeded` | Handle campaign success outcome |
| `_missionName` | Global: current mission name string pointer |
| `_playerDead` | Handle player aircraft loss |
| `@G_Flush@4` | Flush graphics to screen |

**Campaign-specific imports (KURILE.CAM example):**

| Function | Role |
|----------|------|
| `_KurileMedals` | Kurile-specific medal award logic |
| `_KurilePromotions` | Rank promotion handling |
| `_KurileQuit` | Campaign exit handler |
| `_KurileRescued` | Rescued pilot tracking |

UKRAINE.CAM, VIETNAM.CAM, etc. import analogous `_Ukraine*` / `_Vietnam*` functions from FA.EXE.

## TODO — Deep Dive

- ~~Disassemble UKRAINE.CAM to confirm the binary layout~~ **RESOLVED (2026-05-18):** KURILE.CAM analyzed via `AnalyzeCAMDLL.java`. Dispatch at PE offset 0x1000, command protocol mapped, import table extracted. See `%FA_PROJECT%/output/AnalyzeCAMDLL.txt`.
- ~~Identify which `.MC` files correspond to which campaigns and missions~~ **RESOLVED (2026-05-18):** The `.M` mission file carries a `code <name>` directive that names the `.MC` DLL for that mission. Each `.CAM` mission list entry maps 1:1 to a `.M` file; the `.M` file selects its own condition DLL. Most missions use per-mission files (`U01.MC`, `K16.MC`, etc.); bonus missions share `EXTRA01.MC`.
- ~~Determine how `.CAM` references theater `.MM` files~~ **RESOLVED (2026-05-18):** It doesn't. The `.M` mission file carries the `map <theater>.T2` and `layer <sky>.LAY` directives. `.CAM` only contains the ordered mission filename list. See *Reference Chain* section above.
- Disassemble `FUN_00428340` (post-init finalizer called twice in the launch sequence) to determine its role
