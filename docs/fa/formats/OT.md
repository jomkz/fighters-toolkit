# OT — Static Object Definition (.OT)

FA_2.LIB contains 170 .OT files. Each defines one static (non-moving) scenery or target object — buildings, bridges, trees, flags, runways, radar dishes, etc.

**Format:** Brent's Relocatable Format (plain text). NOT a Win32 PE DLL. File sizes after decompression vary (e.g. BLDG1.OT=1256 bytes, SA3SITE.OT=similar).

**Location:** FA_2.LIB | **Count:** 170

**Related:** SH.md (3D shapes), NT.md (moving targets), T2.md (terrain maps that place OT objects), M.md (mission files that instantiate OT objects as targets)

## Structure

Single-section structure (OBJ_TYPE only — no NPC_TYPE or PROJ_TYPE).

### OBJ_TYPE

```
[brent's_relocatable_format]

;---------------- START OF OBJ_TYPE ----------------
;---------------- general info ----------------

    byte 1                  ; object category (1 = static object)
    word 166                ; hitpoints (durability)
    word 0                  ; object subtype ID
    ptr ot_names
    dword $521              ; capability flags
    word $100               ; flags2
    ptr shape               ; 3D model reference
    dword 0 ... (reserved fields, same layout as JT/NT)
    dword 1956              ; year placed / era introduced
    word 195                ; (param)
    word 0
    word 100 ... word 100   ; (performance/damage-resistance params)
    byte 35                 ; (armor/hardness)
    byte 15
    dword 0
    word 0

;---------------- movement info ----------------
    word 0 ... (all zeros — static objects do not move)
    symbol _OBJProc         ; static object callback

;---------------- sound info ----------------
    dword 0 ... (all zeros — most static objects have no ambient sound)
```

### Labels Section

```
:ot_names
    string "Factory 3"
    string "Factory 3"
    string "BLDG1.OT"
:shape
    string "bld1.SH"
    end
```

## Notes

- Static objects have no `loopSound` ptr, no `secondSound`, and no hardpoints.
- The movement info block is all zeros.
- `_OBJProc` handles collision detection, destruction events, and visibility only.
- The `~` prefix has two distinct uses: (1) **destruction state replacement** — `~BNK5.OT` is "Damaged Shelter 5" with a destroyed model (`dbk5.SH`), zeroed `dmg_armor`, and bit 5 of `ot_flags` cleared; placed by the engine at the same world position after the base object is destroyed. (2) **campaign/theater variant** — `~COLTWR.OT` is an enhanced version of COLTWR with an added loop sound and bit 22 set, used in a specific campaign. Check the `~` prefix section in ARCHITECTURE.md for the full list.

## Calibration

### `obj_class` word — Confirmed values

| Value | Class | Representative files |
|-------|-------|---------------------|
| `$40` | Scenery / terrain feature | TREE1-2, ROAD*, LOT, CITY1-3, CRATER, CROPA/B, FLAG*, RES1-2, HOUS*, HOOCH, MOOSEA/B |
| `$100` | Ground structure | BLDG1-3, BNK1-9, STRIP1-7, HANGR, SILO, TOWER, COMM, BUNKER, SHELT |

`$40` covers both pure scenery (TREE, ROAD) and targetable-but-civilian structures (CITY blocks, urban terrain). `$100` covers all military and airfield structures.

Naval and vehicle classes appear in NT files only (`$2000` = ship, `$1000` = SAM, etc.).

### `ot_flags` dword — Observed bit map

Full survey of all 170 OT files. Bit positions confirmed by cross-category comparison.

| Bit | Mask | Label | Status | Notes |
|-----|------|-------|--------|-------|
| 0 | `$1` | **targetable** | Confirmed | Absent on TREE, ROAD, LOT, CRATER, DEST, REACTB (pure scenery / already-destroyed states) |
| 5 | `$20` | **armed / valid combat target** | **Confirmed** — `FUN_0043df7b` | Hard gate in targeting acquisition: entity with bit 5 clear is immediately rejected as a valid target. Absent on civilian variants (BLDG2 `$501`) and ~ destroyed-state replacements. |
| 8 | `$100` | **has collideable oriented geometry** | **Confirmed** — `FUN_0042c9b0` | When set with a non-zero heading, uses angle-based hit detection (calls `FUN_004c6654`). Present on bridges, most structures, rocks; absent on flat terrain tiles (ROAD, LOT, TREE). |
| 10 | `$400` | **civilian or dual-use infrastructure** | Inferred | Set on BLDG*, HOUS*, urban blocks, airport buildings (APTLA/B/C), NUCOB, REACTR; also on SAM infrastructure sites (SA3SITE, HAWKSITE) — not exclusively civilian. Not yet confirmed via entity+0x09 bit test in Ghidra. |
| 11 | `$800` | **animated / non-static scenery** | **Confirmed** — `FUN_0042c9b0` | OBJ_TYPE+9 & 0x800 sets a ground-mobile state flag in the targeting/collision resolver. Set on FLAG*, CROP*, CITY1-3, BR*END (bridge endpoints), SUPPLY, PRDR1/2 (rotating radar dish), MOOSEA/B, MICRO/MICROM (comm dish), CRANE, COMM, BRD1. |
| 15 | `$8000` | **airfield surface** | **Confirmed** — `FUN_00425196` | When set, forces targeting category to 4 (flight deck special class), bypassing normal flags2-based lookup. Also tested combined with bit 22 (`& 0x408000`) in targeting eligibility. Exclusive to STRIP1-7 and DTSTRP. |
| 17 | `$20000` | **military / hardened structure** | Confirmed | Set on BNK*, HANGR*, COMM, NUCCT, PRDR*, RELAY, TOWER, COLTWR, CTWR*, and other military targets. |
| 20 | `$100000` | **damaged runway surface** | Inferred | DTSTRP only; contrasts with bit 21 on intact STRIP*. |
| 21 | `$200000` | **intact runway surface** | Inferred | STRIP1-7; absent on DTSTRP (damaged variant). |
| 22 | `$400000` | **prominent/large variant** | **Confirmed** — `FUN_0042c9b0` | When set, collision geometry uses hit-point count of 16 (`0x10`); when clear, uses full default geometry. Also tested combined with bit 15 (`& 0x408000`) for targeting eligibility. Set on SHELT, BUNKER, HANGRB, CTOWR, FUEL, OILW, DOCK1, COMM, REACTR, CTYBKA/B, APTLA, ~COLTWR. |

Bits 9, 12–14, 16, 18–19, 23+ not observed in any OT file in FA_2.LIB.

| DTSTRP | `$108021` | 0, 5, 15, 20 |

### Hitpoint scale

All confirmed in the `word hitpoints` field (field index 23). Values appear to be absolute damage points. Compare `dmg_armor` across JT weapon types against object `hit_points` to calibrate survivability.

## TODO

- **Bit 10 (`$400`)**: **Resolved.** `_Reaction_12` (0x464040) and `_MaskEvents_4` (0x463ea0) confirmed as the `entity+0x09 & 0x400` testers; also toggles bay-door actuator.
