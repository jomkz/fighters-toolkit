# Music Playlist / Sequencer (.MUS)

FA_2.LIB contains 9 `.MUS` files (e.g. `M_AIR.MUS`). These control background music playback. Each is a **Win32 PE DLL** loaded at runtime.

## Format

Win32 PE DLL. All observed `.MUS` files decompress to **4608 bytes**. String analysis of `M_AIR.MUS` yields only the standard PE header strings — no embedded `.XMI` track names are visible as plain text, confirming XMI references are encoded as integer indices resolved at runtime.

The `.XMI` files in FA_2.LIB are the actual audio sequences. Each `.MUS` file is a **bytecode script** (not compiled x86 code) that sequences XMI track playback.

## Location

| LIB | Count |
|-----|-------|
| FA_2.LIB | 9 |

## File Structure

Each file contains a standard **DOS MZ stub** (128 bytes) followed by a **Phar Lap PE header** (`PL\0\0`) at offset `0x80` (pointed to by the `u32` at `0x3C`). The bytecode CODE section begins at offset `0x200`.

## XMI Track Index Mapping

XMI track index `N` maps to file `AIRnnn.XMI`, where `nnn` is the zero-padded decimal value of `N`:

```
index  1 → VALK01.XMI
index  3 → AIR003.XMI
index  4 → AIR004.XMI
…
index 127 → AIR127.XMI
```

The index space is **sparse** — many slots have no corresponding file in FA_2.LIB (e.g. indices 2, 8, 10–12, 15, 17, 20, 27, 29, 30, 32–37, etc.). The numeric suffix in the filename IS the track index; `VALK01.XMI` is the sole exception to the `AIRnnn` naming pattern and occupies index 1.

All 78 XMI files are in FA_2.LIB only (FA_1.LIB contains none; FA_3.LIB is disc-2 content).

## Bytecode Script Format (Confirmed)

### Opcode table

| Opcode | Length | Meaning |
|--------|--------|---------|
| `FF <name\0>` | variable | Playlist identifier string (e.g. `"air"`) |
| `FA <sub> <u32>` | 6 bytes | Setup/config; confirmed `sub` values: `0x21`, `0x32`, `0x50`, `0x19` |
| `FB <mode> <idx> F9` | 4 bytes | Play XMI track `<idx>`; confirmed `mode` values: `0x50`, `0x5A`, `0x32`, `0x19` |
| `FB <mode> <idx>` | 3 bytes | Play XMI track — short form (no `F9` terminator); appears in M_LAUNCH context |
| `FC` | 1 byte | Shuffle/loop marker; followed by state dispatch block `01 02 03 02 01 02 03 02 01` |
| `FE <u32>` | 5 bytes | Conditional branch (game-state test) |
| `FD <u24>` | 4 bytes | Loop / jump |

The `01 02 03 02 01 02 03 02 01` byte pattern immediately following `FC` is a **state machine dispatch table** — the same pattern appears in DLG CODE sections just before JMP thunks, identifying it as a shared engine construct.

### All 9 playlists decoded

| File | Playlist ID | Track indices | Notes |
|------|-------------|--------------|-------|
| `M_AIR.MUS` | `"air"` | 4 6 107 108 109 18 110 116 117 118 119 24 **29** 21 121 122 123 125 126 127 \| 9 38 62 65 67 19 | 26 tracks in two groups split by `FE` conditional; index 29 has no file in FA_2.LIB |
| `M_NORMAL.MUS` | `"air"` | 14 70 71 72 73 74 47 61 40 75 76 77 78 44 4 39 22 28 48 40 80 81 82 83 84 26 19 43 85 86 87 88 89 46 13 23 90 91 92 94 7 9 31 38 44 | 45 tracks; longest playlist |

| `M_VALK.MUS` | `"valk"` | 1 | 1 track → VALK01.XMI; valkyrie/dogfight state |
| `M_DECK.MUS` | `"air"` | 14 13 43 | 3 tracks; carrier deck state |
| `M_HOME.MUS` | `"air"` | 25 26 40 | 3 tracks; return-to-base |
| `M_LAUNCH.MUS` | `"air"` | 7 9 44 31 38 44 | 6 tracks (44 repeated); uses 3-byte `FB` form |
| `M_EJECT.MUS` | `"air"` | *(none)* | No `FB` opcodes; contains only `FD`/`FE` control flow — eject event redirects state rather than starting a new track |
| `M_SUCC.MUS` | `"air"` | *(none)* | No `FB` opcodes; mission-success event is state control only |

### M_AIR.MUS decoded (detailed)

Playlist ID: `"air"` (in-flight music); CODE section at file offset `0x200`.

Setup opcodes:
- `FA 21 0x48` — likely fade-in time
- `FA 21 0x7E` — likely fade-out time
- `FA 32 0x30` — likely tempo/volume

Group 1 (low-intensity, 20 tracks): `4 6 107 108 109 18 110 116 117 118 119 24 29 21 121 122 123 125 126 127`

`FE 0x48` conditional (game-state branch)

Group 2 (high-intensity, 6 tracks): `9 38 62 65 67 19`

## Playback Architecture (Confirmed via Ghidra)

Traced from `_SEQmusic` (`0x00446B70`), `?MusicOn` (`0x004329E0`), `?MusicVolume` (`0x00432B40`) in FA.EXE.

### Call chain

```
_SEQmusic(name, seq_idx)
  → appends name to base path (DAT_004f4f6c) to form "M_AIR.MUS" etc.
  → calls MusicOn(filename, seq_idx)
      → RMAccess(filename, 0x10c)   — loads MUS DLL from LIB archive
      → _AIL_allocate_sequence_handle   — allocate Miles Sound System handle
      → _AIL_init_sequence(handle, mus_data, seq_idx)  — pass MUS CODE section to AIL
      → _AIL_start_sequence(handle)     — begin playback
```

**The MUS CODE section is passed directly to the Miles Sound System (AIL).** FA does not interpret the FA/FB/FC/FD/FE bytes itself — Miles processes them natively as XMIDI or MSS sequence data. The sub-opcode semantics (`FA 0x19`, `FA 0x21`, etc.) are Miles-internal and cannot be decoded from FA.EXE alone.

### Volume

`?MusicVolume(vol)` maps the 0–100 game volume scale to AIL's 0–127 range:
```
AIL_set_XMIDI_master_volume(handle, vol * 127 / 100)
```

### `_SEQfadein` / `_SEQfadeout`

These (`0x00446890` / `0x00446910`) are **palette (screen) fades**, not music fades. They operate on a 768-byte RGB palette table (256 × 3 bytes at `curPalette`). They are unrelated to MUS audio.

### `seq_idx` parameter

The `short param_2` passed through `_SEQmusic` → `MusicOn` → `_AIL_init_sequence` is the **AIL sequence index** — which section of the XMIDI data to start playback from. Normally 0 (first sequence).

## Toolkit Roadmap

- New `cli/cmd_mus.cpp` — `ft mus dump <file.MUS>` prints the raw opcode stream and resolves `FB <idx>` values to XMI filenames using the index rule above
- No lib codec needed — MUS is passed to AIL as-is; the dump walks the byte stream
