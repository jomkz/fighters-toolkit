# Documentation

The format specifications here were made possible by the
**[OpenFA project](https://gitlab.com/openfa/openfa)**, a GPLv3 open-source
reverse-engineering effort in Rust. Our role was to re-implement the formats in C++17,
validate them against the full game dataset, and document the findings.

## Known .LIB Files (Fighters Anthology)

| File | Location | Key Contents |
|------|----------|--------------|
| FA_1.LIB | Install dir | Fonts (.FNT), UI graphics (.PIC) |
| FA_2.LIB | Install dir | Shapes, missions, audio, type defs, cutscenes, text, palette — 5405 files |
| FA_3.LIB | F:\ (CD) | 822 JPEG-format .PIC textures, 269 .INF aircraft data files |
| FA_4B.LIB | Install dir | Additional assets |

## Verification Results

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| FA_2.LIB full unpack (5405 files) | 5405 OK, 0 failed |
| M/MM round-trip (592 files) | 592/592 byte-exact |
| SH geometry extraction (1275 files) | 1210/1275 with geometry; 65 x86-only effects |
| `F16C_0.PIC` decoded | 512×384 PNG OK |
| `BALTIC.TXT` decompressed | 147 bytes OK |

## Out of Scope

| Format | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| `.HUD`, `.DLG`, `.LAY`, `.MNU` | PE wrapper files; require PE disassembly, low modding value |
| `.MT` | Undocumented; needs hex analysis |
| `.XMI` | Standard Extended MIDI; use external tools for playback |
| SH pack (OBJ→SH) | Too complex given animation/LOD/damage states |
| LZSS (flags=1) | Rare; not yet implemented in ft_lib |
