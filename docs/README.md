# Documentation

The format specifications here were made possible by the
**[OpenFA project](https://gitlab.com/openfa/openfa)**, a GPLv3 open-source
reverse-engineering effort in Rust. Our role was to re-implement the formats in C++17,
validate them against the full game dataset, and document the findings.

| FA_2.LIB full unpack (5405 files) | 5405 OK, 0 failed |
| M/MM round-trip (592 files) | 592/592 byte-exact |

## Out of Scope

| Format | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| `.HUD`, `.DLG`, `.LAY`, `.MNU` | PE wrapper files; require PE disassembly, low modding value |
| `.MT` | Undocumented; needs hex analysis |
| `.XMI` | Standard Extended MIDI; use external tools for playback |
| SH pack (OBJ→SH) | Too complex given animation/LOD/damage states |
| LZSS (flags=1) | Rare; not yet implemented in ft_lib |
